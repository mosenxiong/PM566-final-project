This is my PM566 final project website: https://mosenxiong.github.io/PM566-final-project/

This study sought to understand Chicago crime patterns and trends through three years of data. It not only helps social scientists, policymakers, and law enforcement agencies better understand the safety situation in cities, but also provides the public with transparency about local criminal activity.

Data come from : https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2/data.
